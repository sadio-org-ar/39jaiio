39 JAIIO - 39th Argentine Conference of Informatics - https://www.39jaiio.org.ar - August 30th to September 3rd, 2010 - Buenos Aires, Argentina

Since 1961, SADIO (Argentine Society for Informatics) organizes JAIIO (Argentine Conference of Informatics). JAIIO is one of the most relevant events for the national and regional IT sector, with participants from both industry and academia.

JAIIO is organized as a series of thematic symposia including topics such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, technology, agroinformatics, high performance computing, industrial informatics, free software, law, health, information society, and a student contest.

After many years, JAIIO returns to the city of Buenos Aires.

ASSE 2010 - 11th ARGENTINE SYMPOSIUM ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING �https:///www.39jaiio.org.ar/ASSE/ - September 2nd and 3rd, 2010 - Buenos Aires, Argentina

The 11th Argentine Symposium on Software Engineering (ASSE 2010) will bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners to discuss new ideas, problems and experiences in the field of Software Engineering. ASSE 2010 will be part of the 39th Argentine Conference on Informatics (JAIIO 2010). ASSE 2010 seeks original works in the wide spectrum of Software Engineering, from academic research to industrial and business applications with significant impact and lessons learned from application development. The symposium will feature invited talks, paper and poster sessions, and panels presenting both mature work and new ideas in research and applications.

This year the Keynote Speaker for the event will be Dr. David Garlan, who is one of the most notable researchers in Software Engineering and a professor at the Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University. Professor Garlan is one of the pioneers of the field of Software Architectures. 

SUBMISSION CATEGORIES
Submissions are invited in the following track categories:
- Full research papers: 15 pages maximum length

We encourage submissions relating to all aspects of software engineering, especially on topics of emerging interest. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:

-Requirements Engineering
-Software Specification
-Verification, Validation and Testing
-Software Architecture and Design
-Patterns and Frameworks
-Reverse Engineering, Refactoring, and Evolution
-Program Comprehension and Visualization
-Tools and Environments
-Development Paradigms and Software Processes and Methods
-Software Metrics
-Quality Assurance
-Web Engineering
-Software Engineering Education
-Computer-supported Cooperative Work
-Object Oriented, Component-based, Aspect-oriented, Service-oriented software Engineering
-Model Driven Engineering
-Distributed Systems and Middleware
-Mobile and Embedded Systems
-Open Standards and Certification
-Software Configuration and Deployment
-Software Quality Attributes (safety, security, reliability, etc.)
-Software Project Management
-Legal, Social and Ethical Issues
-Database Technology
 
For experience reports we are inviting practitioners to present new advances or insights in software engineering methods, practices or tools. A contribution should consist of a brief explanation of the method, practice, or tool in question, a description of the context and particulars in which you have experience, the results you�ve achieved, and the lessons you and your organization have learned relative to this method, practice or tool, its applicability, its effectiveness, or insights on how to further improve it. In particular, the content must be practical and relevant, and be presented in a well-documented and thorough manner.
 
All papers must be written in English, Spanish or Portuguese. They will be reviewed by an international Program Committee, which will be composed of members from both Industry and Academia, so that research papers and experience reports can be evaluated by experts in the subject.

Papers may be accepted for presentation as talks or as posters during the conference. All papers and experience reports will be published in SADIO Proceedings of the JAIIO, unless otherwise indicated by authors who prefer not to publish it. Best papers will be invited for publication in the Electronic Journal of SADIO.

This year ASSE will host a special session on Separation of Concerns. Additionally, in order to provide the community a new space for discussion, a Birds of a Feather (BoF) session will take place after the Separation of Concerns session, where people working on related topics (or just interested) will get in touch. We invite people working on Separation of Concerns to send full research papers for the session or a page including title, authors, affiliation and an abstract to the BoF.

IMPORTANT DATES:
-Submission deadline: May 3rd, 2010
-Acceptance notification: June 14th, 2010
-Final version (camera ready) deadline: June 28th, 2010
