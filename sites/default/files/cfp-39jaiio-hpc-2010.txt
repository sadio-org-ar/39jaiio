39 JAIIO - 39 JORNADAS ARGENTINAS DE INFORMÁTICA - www.39jaiio.org.ar
30 de Agosto al 3 de Septiembre de 2010 - Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires

Since 1961, SADIO (Argentine Society for Informatics) organizes JAIIO (Argentine Conference of Informatics). JAIIO is one of the most relevant events for the national and regional IT sector, with participants from both industry and academia.

JAIIO is organized as a series of thematic symposia including topics such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, technology, agroinformatics, high performance computing, industrial informatics, free software, law, health, information society, and a students contest.

After many years, JAIIO returns to the Buenos Aires city.

 _HPC 2010 - HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING SYMPOSIUM 2010_
 
OVERVIEW
Building on the great success of the first two editions of the HPC symposium in 2008 and 2009, this year's conference aims to bring together researchers, developers, and users of HPC to discuss new ideas, experiences, and problems.

HPC2010 will be part of the 39th Argentine Conference of Informatics (39 JAIIO), the international conference of the Argentine Society for Informatics (SADIO), to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on August 2010.

The use and development of High-Performance Computing (HPC) in Latin America is steadily growing. New challenges come from the new capabilities provided by clusters, grids, and distributed systems for HPC, promoting research and innovation in this area.

The main goal of HPC2010 is to provide a regional forum fostering the growth of the HPC community in Latin America through the exchange and dissemination of new ideas, techniques, and research in HPC.

The symposium will feature invited talks from academy and industry, tutorials, short- and full-paper sessions presenting both mature work and new ideas in research and industrial applications.
